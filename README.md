# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## Instructions

1. Install Python 3.x on your machine if it's not already installed. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the Pygame library by running the following command in your terminal:
              pip install pygame

3. Download the `snake_game.py` file from this repository.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved `snake_game.py`.

5. Run the game by executing the following command: 
               python snake_game.py
               
6. The game window will open, and you can start playing the Snake game.

7. Use the arrow keys to control the snake. Try to eat the food (red block) to grow longer. Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body, as it will result in game over.

8. When the game ends, you can press "Q" to quit or "C" to play again.
